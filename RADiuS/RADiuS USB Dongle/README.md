RADiuS USB Dongle 
===

Not long after the release of the shield... Rasperry Pi came on the scene. It's not much bigger than a deck of playing cards but features: on-board ethernet, HDMI, composite video, audio out, USB, SD-card reader, GPIOs, and runs off 5 volts. It's pretty amazing how far we've come since the late 90s.

This design was intended for Raspberry Pi... however, it is compatible with any OS that will support FTDI Virtual Com Port Drivers (Mac, Windows, Windows CE, Linux, Embedded Linux, etc.) and has a USB 2.0 port.
