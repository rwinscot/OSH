RADiuS USB Dongle with SMA Connector
===

We've forked the original RADiuS-D design, and have moved to an SMA connector here. This means that one PCB can be used with any of the easyRadio modules paired with an appropriate antenna that terminates in an SMA connector. Can you say YAGI?

This design was intended for Raspberry Pi... however, it is compatible with any OS that will support FTDI Virtual Com Port Drivers (Mac, Windows, Windows CE, Linux, Embedded Linux, etc.) and has a USB 2.0 port.
