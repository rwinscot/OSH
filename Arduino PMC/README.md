Arduino Pro-Micro Castellon (surface-mount footprint)
===

Sick of breadboarding Arduino? Me too... I found the SMDuino project which was an great introduction to castellon board-edge connectors. However, the design wasn't exactly what I had in mind; I really wanted to take advantage of the ATMega 32U4.

Not long after I got the itch for a drop-in surface mount Arduino, Sparkfun announced the Pro Micro. I immediately connected the two... and the Arudino PMC was born.

 * reduced footprint to original pro-micro
 * trace changes as needed to preserve ground
 * added a third feducial
