"I walked into the doctors office the other day... and after weighing me, the nurse asked me how tall I was. I said, 'five foot... AWESOME!'"

Arduino PMC
---
An Arduino with a surface-mount footprint made possible by castellon PCB/edge pads. Similar in concept to the SMDuino project... but I use the ATMega 32U4.


C2B
---
A coin cell breakout that can be used with a single or 'stacked' CR2032 battery. The result is 3v for the single and 6v for the double. Operationally and mechanically superior to anything on the planet.


RADiuS
---
Several projects that leverage the easyRadio wireless module from Low Power Radio Solutions. Something for Arduino, something for Raspberry Pi, something for just about any OS!



More projects coming soon!
